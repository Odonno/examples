# Face Recognition with Flask and OpenCV

This project demonstrates a face recognition application using Flask, OpenCV, and Keras FaceNet. It captures a snapshot from the laptop camera, compares it with photos stored in the data folder, and displays the recognition results.

## Features

- Start and stop the camera stream
- Capture a photo from the camera
- Perform face recognition using Keras FaceNet
- Display the recognition results

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Flask (for serving static files and client-side interactions)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-flask.git
cd face-recognition-flask

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
